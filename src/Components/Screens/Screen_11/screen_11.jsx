Offer may not be available in all stores and may vary between <br /> in‑store and online trade‑in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade‑in partners reserve the right to refuse, cancel, or limit quantity of any trade‑in <br /> transaction for any reason. More details are available from Apple’s trade-in partner for trade‑in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
